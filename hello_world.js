// there are three ways of creating variable
// let, var and const

//let's see some example

let color = 'blue'

var college = 'MCTC'

const language = 'javascript'

// const variable , we can't change const variable, and they are very helpful to assign variable
// that we know that we are not going to change

let quantity = 5

let programmer = 7

// in javascript the number variables are similar both for int and float

let hello = 'hi programmer'
// to assign string variable, we can use both single and double quote but don't mix up

// unlike python, here we can concatenate string and numbers
